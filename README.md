# "Simon Says" Piano MVP
- a button to start/restart the game
- a keyboard graphic that will play a specific note when clicked with a mouse (or maybe mapped to the computer keyboard?)
- the corresponding "piano" key should light up on the screen when a note is played.
- the computer should pick a note randomly. If I repeat the note correctly by selecting the correct key on the "piano," the computer should re-play the sequence so far and add another random note. The computer should continue adding notes to the sequence until I make an error in reproducing the sequence
- a counter to track the number of notes I have memorized in my current sequence
- the game to congratulate me and show me the number of notes I memorized before my streak ended

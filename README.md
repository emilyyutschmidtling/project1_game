# "Simon Says" Piano

Simon Says Piano is a "follow the leader" memory game played on a virtual piano keyboard. Click "start" to start the game.  Simon's piano will play a note.  If you successfully play back the note on the piano keyboard using your mouse, Simon will add a new note to the sequence for you to duplicate.  How long can you keep up?

**_About the Making of this Game_**

This game was built using HTML5, Javascript, JQuery, and CSS, and tested on Chrome.

I started with the piano keyboard, which is adapted from the HTML5 Piano (http://www.html5piano.ilinov.eu/) and Taufik Nurrohman's Pure CSS3 Piano (http://cssdeck.com/labs/full/pure-css3-piano).  The piano sounds were taken from Piano in 162, a sample library of a Steinway Model B grand piano performed by Simon Dalzell, an undergraduate at The University of Arizona.

Once the virtual piano keyboard was functional, I then turned my attention to expressing the game logic in Javascript.  Future planned updates for the project include:

- dressing up the game page to make it look a little nicer and more finished;
- adding a counter to the screen so players can track progress while they are playing the game;
- adding functionality to allow players to play the game with random notes or actual melodies;
- adding a computer keypad option for playing the virtual piano keyboard;
- exploring options for the sound files to improve processing when playing the game online.
